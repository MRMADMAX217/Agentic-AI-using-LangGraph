    "essay = \"\"\"India in the Age of AI\n",
    "As the world enters a transformative era defined by artificial intelligence (AI), India stands at a critical juncture — one where it can either emerge as a global leader in AI innovation or risk falling behind in the technology race. The age of AI brings with it immense promise as well as unprecedented challenges, and how India navigates this landscape will shape its socio-economic and geopolitical future.\n",
    "\n",
    "India's strengths in the AI domain are rooted in its vast pool of skilled engineers, a thriving IT industry, and a growing startup ecosystem. With over 5 million STEM graduates annually and a burgeoning base of AI researchers, India possesses the intellectual capital required to build cutting-edge AI systems. Institutions like IITs, IIITs, and IISc have begun fostering AI research, while private players such as TCS, Infosys, and Wipro are integrating AI into their global services. In 2020, the government launched the National AI Strategy (AI for All) with a focus on inclusive growth, aiming to leverage AI in healthcare, agriculture, education, and smart mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most promising applications of AI in India lies in agriculture, where predictive analytics can guide farmers on optimal sowing times, weather forecasts, and pest control. In healthcare, AI-powered diagnostics can help address India’s doctor-patient ratio crisis, particularly in rural areas. Educational platforms are increasingly using AI to personalize learning paths, while smart governance tools are helping improve public service delivery and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the path to AI-led growth is riddled with challenges. Chief among them is the digital divide. While metropolitan cities may embrace AI-driven solutions, rural India continues to struggle with basic internet access and digital literacy. The risk of job displacement due to automation also looms large, especially for low-skilled workers. Without effective skilling and re-skilling programs, AI could exacerbate existing socio-economic inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pressing concern is data privacy and ethics. As AI systems rely heavily on vast datasets, ensuring that personal data is used transparently and responsibly becomes vital. India is still shaping its data protection laws, and in the absence of a strong regulatory framework, AI systems may risk misuse or bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "To harness AI responsibly, India must adopt a multi-stakeholder approach involving the government, academia, industry, and civil society. Policies should promote open datasets, encourage responsible innovation, and ensure ethical AI practices. There is also a need for international collaboration, particularly with countries leading in AI research, to gain strategic advantage and ensure interoperability in global systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "India’s demographic dividend, when paired with responsible AI adoption, can unlock massive economic growth, improve governance, and uplift marginalized communities. But this vision will only materialize if AI is seen not merely as a tool for automation, but as an enabler of human-centered development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, India in the age of AI is a story in the making — one of opportunity, responsibility, and transformation. The decisions we make today will not just determine India’s AI trajectory, but also its future as an inclusive, equitable, and innovation-driven society.\"\"\""

       " 'language_feedback': 'The essay effectively communicates India\\'s opportunities and challenges with AI, covering relevant points across various sectors. The ideas presented are clear and show a basic understanding of the topic. However, the language quality requires significant improvement. There are numerous grammatical errors, including issues with subject-verb agreement (e.g., \"world change,\" \"India have\"), verb tenses, and article usage. The vocabulary is very basic and repetitive, and the sentence structures are often simplistic or awkward (e.g., \"engine-ear,\" \"doctor place,\" \"put seed,\" \"get more bad,\" \"big big data\"). To enhance the essay, focus on expanding vocabulary, practicing grammar rules, and constructing more varied and complex sentences. Improving these aspects will greatly enhance clarity and readability.',\n",
       " 'analysis_feedback': \"The essay provides a basic overview of the opportunities and challenges of AI in India. It correctly identifies key areas like agriculture, healthcare, and education where AI can be beneficial, and acknowledges important issues such as the digital divide, job displacement, and data privacy. The emphasis on inclusive AI development is a strong point. However, the depth of analysis is quite limited. Arguments are presented in a very simplistic manner without sufficient elaboration, examples, or supporting details. For instance, while job loss is mentioned, there's no discussion of potential mitigation strategies or the types of jobs most affected. Similarly, the privacy concerns are highlighted but lack a deeper exploration of the complexities involved in data governance. The language used is very informal and contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, which detracts significantly from the essay's credibility and clarity. To improve, the essay would benefit from more detailed explanations of each point, concrete examples, and a more formal and precise writing style.\",\n",

The writer effectively identifies India's strengths, potential applications of AI in various sectors (agriculture, health, education), and crucial challenges such as the digital divide, job displacement, and data privacy. The emphasis on inclusive AI development, ensuring benefits reach all citizens, is a strong and consistently articulated theme. While the language, grammar, and vocabulary are very simplistic and contain numerous errors, they do not entirely obscure the underlying clarity of thought and the well-structured argument presented.\",\n",
